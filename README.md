# Visio_CAD
#First official release! Everything works for the most part! Some of the things that need to be worked on noted by Jesse

1. GUI messes up after going back hundreds of AP's in the Visio Tool.
2. CAD Tool displays old name rather than the new name ex. displays DEN5-XX-00051 rather than DEN5-XX-00052H. In other words the GUI is 1 AP behind
3. CAD Cutsheet does not support "CSV"
4. If you use an existing CAD Cutsheet it will save over all the old contents.
